Deep Learning Compression



Ideas:
- Element by element compression with new base once new value falls outside of base boundary
- Weight Compression along z dimension
- Image compression using clusters
- Reduce resolution of input by 2(basically round to even/ odd numbers)
- Change memcpy if you find a faster function?
